## Experience
#### Machine Learning Engineer Intern
May 2023 - Present

Viasat

* Building full-stack machine learning app for determining if a supplier issue is systemic in a historical record of text
based documents that track supplier problems. Accomplished this by implementing an open source embedding
model for Dense Passage Retrieval to determine if similar documents/issues have been seen before and how often
that problem has occurred.
* Deployment stack includes a Vue.js frontend, Weaviate vector database backend, an embedding model hosted on
AWS Sagemaker & tied into Weaviate, an Argo ETL refresh process to ingest new documents as they are written,
and a FastAPI proxy in between Vue and Weaviate. Built app infrastructure using Helm/Kubernetes/Docker

#### Data Science Intern
May 2022 - November 2022

Lockheed Martin

* Queried, cleaned, and transformed 450 million time series IIOT data points.
* Engineered and tested features by feeding them into various models (PCA, Random Forest, LSTM) and identifying
anomalies for predictive maintenance.
* Recreated several Python scripts in Tableau using SQL to reach end users easier.
* Created a KPI for Industrial CNC machine productivity and progress using IIOT data and Grafana. Deployed on
factory floor for machine operators to monitor progress.
* Processed large corpora of text investment data using spaCy for determining investment and ROI in specifiic
categories. (Lbl2Vec, Topic Modeling)

#### Reinforcement Learning Research Assistant
June 2021 â€“ September 2021

University of Colorado Boulder

* Built birds eye view car simulation using Python. Car was approximated using a simple kinematic bicycle model
and collision detection and reference lanes were built with pygame.

* Integrated the simulation with a Deep Q-learning neural network with custom environment and reward system for
the purpose of navigating paths. Tested different observation and action spaces as well as different network sizes
and hyperparameters
